# NFT Creation
NFT project. Plan is to make hundreds or thousands of one-off NFTs from handful of reference images. I originally started this project in Python, but have since moved the code to C++. I found that C++ is significantly faster and more efficient than Python. Hence, we can create more images in a shorter period of time with C++. This is a ongoing project and will be completed at a later date. My friend and I are still working out the details of the smart contract that accompanies the NFTs. WORK IN PROGRESS!
